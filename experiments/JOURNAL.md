# Loop Journal

Thin, append-only chronological index. One line per event, linking run files.
Cross-experiment notes live here; per-experiment detail lives in `runs/NNNN-<slug>.md`.

- 2026-06-08 — Notebook scaffolded. Seeded backlog: #1 notification-gate-live (live),
  #2 unknown-species-threshold (parked/replay), #3 roi-masking (live).
- 2026-06-08 — First loop tick. Baseline: FP 0.798 (67/84, CI [0.700,0.870]),
  FN unmeasured, volume 84/night. Deploy HELD: #1 gate not wired into live
  notification path / BOUNDS — infra blocker, not FN-veto. Shadow gate would cut
  70/72 FP (97%) at 0/12 animal loss. See runs/0001-notification-gate-live.md.
- 2026-06-09 00:04 — No-op tick (night). No new detections since watermark 84
  (DB still 84; latest data 06-08). metrics re-ingests from the watermark, so it
  measured 0 new triggers and transiently wrote a degenerate 0-trigger 06-09 row;
  reverted — restored 06-08 baseline in state.last_metrics and dropped the 0/0
  06-09 row from daily.csv (a 0-vs-84 row would falsely read as volume-collapse /
  FP→0 to future ticks). No decision, no deploy (#1 still infra-blocked; FN
  unmeasured). Sent heartbeat. Baseline unchanged.
- 2026-06-09 02:00 — No-op tick (night). Still no new detections since watermark 84
  (ingest --since-id 84 → 0 rows; DB max id == 84). Skipped metrics per the
  watermark-noop rule (it re-ingests from the watermark and would clobber the 06-08
  baseline). state.last_metrics holds 06-08 FP 0.798 (67/84); daily.csv unchanged
  (single 06-08 row). No decision, no deploy (#1 still infra-blocked; FN unmeasured;
  not paused). Sent heartbeat.
- 2026-06-09 04:00 — No-op tick (night, ~04:00 CEST). Still no new detections since
  watermark 84 (DB max id == 84; detection_feedback == 17). Skipped metrics per the
  watermark-noop rule (re-ingests from watermark; would clobber the 06-08 baseline
  with a 0-trigger row). state.last_metrics holds 06-08 FP 0.798 (67/84); daily.csv
  unchanged (single 06-08 row). No decision, no deploy (#1 still infra-blocked; FN
  unmeasured; not paused). Sent heartbeat.
- 2026-06-09 — USER NOTE (Daniel, reviewing the 06-08 baseline FP triggers): "I am
  very surprised by the alarms — these are all pretty much the same images. Why
  didn't they get filtered out by the background comparison?" Observation: a large
  share of the 67 FP appear to be recurrent, near-identical static scenes that MOG2
  background subtraction should have absorbed into the background model. Open
  question for a future tick: why aren't repeated/static frames suppressed? Candidate
  causes to investigate — central-region weighting re-amplifying the same edge motion,
  motion_threshold (500px) low enough that residual MOG2 noise clears it, MOG2 learning
  rate / history=500 vs trigger cadence, or shadow/lighting drift. Filed as backlog #4
  (mog2-recurrent-frames). Potentially high-impact FP reduction if confirmed.
- 2026-06-09 (night tick) — First new-data day. Ingested 185 detections (watermark
  84→269, all 06-09 daytime h7–18; 47 human-labeled). Measured FP 0.616 (114/185,
  CI [0.544,0.683]) vs 06-08 0.798 — but NOT a validated win (see self-audit).
  SELF-AUDIT (critical): tier-1 auto-labels agree with humans only 17/47 (36%),
  biased toward calling FP "animal" (24/30 disagreements); human dist 43 FP /
  4 wrong_species / 0 confirmed animals. → reconciled FP rate is an UNDERESTIMATE;
  no auto-label-based FP "win" is trustworthy. This label-trust gap gates every FP
  experiment. Promoted #4 (mog2-recurrent-frames) to running/diagnosis. #4 finding:
  motion features do NOT separate FP from animal (motion_area med 1143 vs 1142; 0/114
  FP near the 500px threshold) → threshold tuning is FN-vetoed & futile. Recurrence
  hypothesis needs scene-recurrence instrumentation (ROI centroid or ROI aHash) not
  currently logged — observability-only, zero FN risk, but multi-file + schema
  migration → flagged to Daniel for design review rather than shipped blind tonight.
  Gate #1 re-confirmed (92 suppress: 88 FP + 4 wrong_species, 0 animal = 100% prec)
  but still infra-blocked. Decision: HOLD, no deploy. Not paused, not frozen
  (47 human labels today). See runs/0002-mog2-recurrent-frames.md.
- 2026-06-09 (late, human-directed) — CORRECTION to the tick above. Scene recurrence
  WAS testable on existing data (no instrumentation needed): aHash over the saved
  frames showed 80% of adjacent triggers near-identical and 100 triggers collapsing
  into ~15 visual scenes (one 62-trigger scene over ~6h). Viewing the frames: a fixed
  sunlit garden with a swinging bird-feeder + wind-blown vegetation + moving sun-dapple
  — recurring REAL motion, NOT static scenes MOG2 "failed to absorb." MOG2 detects
  inter-frame change, not scene novelty; wind motion is non-periodic and the ~45s
  no-sampling gap after each trigger (cooldown + species-ID) keeps it from being
  learned. Levers: scene-recurrence dedup gate (aHash, live, no schema), SpeciesNet
  no-animal gate (#1), or vegetation-motion suppression — not "fix MOG2." Loop prompt
  updated (79ccd37) to check existing data before proposing instrumentation. See
  runs/0002 correction section.
- 2026-06-11 (human-directed) — Shipped exp #1 (notification-gate-live) as
  SAME-CHANNEL LABELING: 🔍 REVIEW header on NO_ANIMAL/UNCLASSIFIABLE captions
  (`is_review_detection` in data_models; `PERFORMANCE_REVIEW_PREFIX_ENABLED`
  default on). FN-safe (labels, doesn't drop/route) → no 2nd channel, no FN-veto.
  gate_would_suppress column untouched. Live on next camera restart. See
  runs/0001-notification-gate-live.md.
- 2026-06-10 (night tick) — Second new-data day; 87 triggers (watermark 269→356,
  06-10 h6–20; 31 human-labeled). FIXED the label-trust meta-blocker: cross-tabbing
  detection_status vs human labels isolated a single unidirectional error —
  `unclassifiable` (MegaDetector boxes a region, classifier can't ID) was mapped to
  tier-1 "animal" but is 27/27 false_positive across all history (the camera boxing
  wind-blown vegetation / the swinging feeder). Changed _STATUS_TO_TIER1
  ["unclassifiable"]="false_positive" in src/loop/ingest.py (commit 8f3ff01) — a
  metrics-reconciliation change only, zero FN risk, no camera restart. Effect:
  tier-1↔human concordance 29%→74% (06-10), 36%→64% (06-09); de-biased FP 0.724
  (06-09) / 0.874 (06-10) vs the masked 0.616/0.678 — the earlier "improvement" was a
  labelling artifact, true FP is HIGH and trending UP. last_metrics recomputed: FP
  0.874 (76/87, CI [0.788,0.928]), trustworthy. Recurrence re-confirmed on today's
  frames (87→~32 scenes, 49% adjacent near-identical, top scenes 0 'animal'); largest
  12-trigger scene mostly missed by the no-animal gate (2/12) → scene-dedup is
  complementary. Gate #1 today: 51 suppress, 0 animal (precision holds) but only ~33%
  FP recall (misses the unclassifiable FP class). Strongest lever = route
  detection_status∈{no_animal,unclassifiable} to a REVIEW channel (routing not
  suppression: the 6 no_animal wrong_species are real animals); still infra-blocked on
  a 2nd Telegram channel Daniel must provision. Decision: HOLD on camera deploy, no
  pending_restart. Not paused, not frozen. See runs/0002-mog2-recurrent-frames.md.
- 2026-06-11 (night tick) — Third new-data day; 109 triggers (watermark 356→465,
  06-11 h6–18; 40 human labels — not feedback-starved). **FP 90/109 = 0.826, CI
  [0.744, 0.885], trustworthy** — indistinguishable from 06-10's 0.874 (overlapping
  CIs); FP stably HIGH, FN structurally unmeasured. Two decisions this tick:
  (1) **CONCLUDED exp #4 (mog2-recurrent-frames)** — a diagnosis-only experiment
  (param_delta always null). Its three findings are stable across 3 nights:
  recurrence = REAL motion (swinging feeder/wind/sun-dapple), NOT static scenes MOG2
  failed to absorb; motion features don't separate FP from animal → all MOTION/ROI
  sensitivity tuning FN-vetoed & futile (no env lever in BOUNDS reaches the root
  cause); the actionable lever it surfaced was shipped as exp #1's labeling. Decision:
  inconclusive-as-deploy, diagnosis-successful, closed. (2) **PROMOTED exp #1
  (notification-gate-live) to running and brought it LIVE.** The committed REVIEW-
  labeling code (31d3bc6) was DORMANT — the camera only reloads code when
  wildlife-deploy.timer (03:30 CEST) finds a due pending_restart_at, which was null,
  so the shipped feature had never run. Stamped pending_restart_at=2026-06-12T03:00
  → camera restarts at the 03:30 timer, REVIEW labeling live for 06-12. Validated on
  tonight's 109 triggers: is_review_detection (status∈{NO_ANIMAL,UNCLASSIFIABLE})
  flags **89/90 FP = 99% recall** (1 FP slips through, an identified-misclassification);
  unprefixed stream is **15/16 = 94% true animals**; **0 FN** (3/18 animals get a
  cosmetic REVIEW prefix but are still fully shown). active_experiment_id 4→1. Not
  paused, not frozen, no env delta, no volume change. See runs/0001 & runs/0002.
- 2026-06-13 16:25 CEST — **LOCATION CHANGE / RE-BASELINE (human-driven, /remote-control).**
  Daniel physically moved the camera to a NEW location. wildlife-camera was stopped
  09:21 for the move (status=143 = SIGTERM, not a crash) and is now restarted clean
  (camera init OK, warmup armed). All old empirical state is OLD-SCENE and invalid for
  the new field of view, so the loop was paused and re-baselined rather than allowed to
  diff new data against stale baselines:
  - `paused: true` AND `wildlife-loop.timer` disabled+stopped (hard pause — nightgate
    does not honor `paused`, only the report banner does, so the timer is the real gate).
  - `baselines.volume_per_night: 84 → 0` (= "no baseline yet" per guardrails.check_volume;
    avoids false volume-collapse/explosion vs the old 84/night).
  - `last_metrics: {06-11 FP 0.826, 90/109} → null` (old-scene FP rate retired; first
    new-scene data tick will repopulate it).
  - `watermark: 465 → 470` (= current max detections.id) so the last old-location triggers
    are NOT ingested into the new baseline. New-scene triggers (id > 470) start fresh.
  - exp #3 roi-masking hypothesis annotated: old ROI geometry no longer applies; re-derive
    from new-scene FP patterns before proposing live. #1 REVIEW-labeling stays live
    (location-agnostic). Old DB (469 dets, 177 labels) + 1.4G images KEPT as archive.
  TO RESUME: let the new scene accumulate ~2-3 nights of triggers + Telegram labels, set
  a fresh volume_per_night baseline, then `paused: false` + `sudo systemctl enable --now
  wildlife-loop.timer`.
