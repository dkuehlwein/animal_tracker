# Loop Journal

Thin, append-only chronological index. One line per event, linking run files.
Cross-experiment notes live here; per-experiment detail lives in `runs/NNNN-<slug>.md`.

- 2026-06-08 — Notebook scaffolded. Seeded backlog: #1 notification-gate-live (live),
  #2 unknown-species-threshold (parked/replay), #3 roi-masking (live).
- 2026-06-08 — First loop tick. Baseline: FP 0.798 (67/84, CI [0.700,0.870]),
  FN unmeasured, volume 84/night. Deploy HELD: #1 gate not wired into live
  notification path / BOUNDS — infra blocker, not FN-veto. Shadow gate would cut
  70/72 FP (97%) at 0/12 animal loss. See runs/0001-notification-gate-live.md.
- 2026-06-09 00:04 — No-op tick (night). No new detections since watermark 84
  (DB still 84; latest data 06-08). metrics re-ingests from the watermark, so it
  measured 0 new triggers and transiently wrote a degenerate 0-trigger 06-09 row;
  reverted — restored 06-08 baseline in state.last_metrics and dropped the 0/0
  06-09 row from daily.csv (a 0-vs-84 row would falsely read as volume-collapse /
  FP→0 to future ticks). No decision, no deploy (#1 still infra-blocked; FN
  unmeasured). Sent heartbeat. Baseline unchanged.
